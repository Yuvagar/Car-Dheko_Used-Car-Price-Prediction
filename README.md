      Automotive Industry , Data Science, Machine Learning
      
Project Scope:
      We have historical data on used car prices from CarDekho, including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from different cities. Your task as a data scientist is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on these features. The model should be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.

Results: 
      A functional and accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices.
      Comprehensive analysis and visualizations of the dataset.
      Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, models, and results.
      An interactive Streamlit application for real-time price predictions based on user input.
